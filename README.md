##Description
This is an app to find a type of dog breed for you. It uses ten questions of the users input and compares them to the array of different dog breeds and returns in a modal the name of said breed and a video found on youtube to go with it.

##Technology Used
 - HTML
 - JSON
 - JavaScript
 - BootStrap
 - Express.JS

##Improvements
I have this app and I've tried working on it but I can't seem to get the data to work. The modal doesn't pop up when given the answers and theres an error calculating where the differences are becoming not a number and therefore cant be compared.
